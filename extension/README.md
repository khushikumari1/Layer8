# **Secure AI Middleware for Private LLMs** 🚀🔒  

### **Overview**  
This project provides a **secure middleware layer** for **private Large Language Models (LLMs)**, enabling industries to leverage AI while protecting **sensitive corporate data**. The middleware ensures that **no confidential information** is exposed to external AI platforms and allows for **on-premise** or **hybrid AI processing**.  

### **Key Features**  
✅ **Private LLM Deployment** – Self-hosted AI models (Llama 3, Mistral, Falcon) with industry-specific fine-tuning.  
✅ **AI Firewall** – Blocks queries containing **sensitive business data** before reaching AI models.  
✅ **Data Masking & Redaction** – **Automatically removes PII** (Personally Identifiable Information) and confidential data.  
✅ **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** – Restricts AI usage to **authorized personnel**.  
✅ **On-Premise & Hybrid AI** – Supports **edge computing** and **local LLM inference** to keep data in-house.  
✅ **Homomorphic Encryption & Secure Enclaves** – Ensures encrypted AI processing (Intel SGX, AWS Nitro, TEEs).  
✅ **Logging & Compliance** – Tracks AI queries and responses for **auditability & anomaly detection**.  

### **How It Works**  
1️⃣ **Intercepts AI Queries** → Middleware processes all user prompts before they reach the LLM.  
2️⃣ **Redacts/Masks Sensitive Data** → Ensures proprietary information is not exposed.  
3️⃣ **Routes to Secure AI** → Queries are directed to either **private LLMs** or **trusted external models** based on sensitivity.  
4️⃣ **Logs & Monitors AI Interactions** → Tracks queries for security compliance.  

### **Use Cases**  
🔹 **Manufacturing & R&D** – Protect proprietary designs & industrial processes.  
🔹 **Finance & Legal** – Securely analyze contracts, financial models, and reports.  
🔹 **Healthcare & Biotech** – Ensure HIPAA-compliant AI processing.  
🔹 **Defense & Government** – Secure intelligence data from unauthorized AI access.  

### **Tech Stack**  
- **LLM Models**: Deepseek, Mistral (Fine-Tuned)  
- **Security**: Encryption, Secure Enclaves (Intel SGX, AWS Nitro)  
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, API Gateway  

### **Getting Started**  
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/secure-llm-middleware.git
cd Layer8
```
